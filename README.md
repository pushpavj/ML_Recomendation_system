ML_Recomendation_system


The purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. It involves a number of factors to create personalised lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual.

Recommendation systems are Artificial Intelligence based algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual.
 
These results are based on their profile, search/browsing history, what other people with similar traits/demographics are watching, and how likely are you to watch those movies. This is achieved through predictive modeling using available data.
